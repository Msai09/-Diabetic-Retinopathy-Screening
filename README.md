Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
Introduction:
Diabetic retinopathy is a serious condition that affects individuals with diabetes, potentially leading to permanent blindness if not diagnosed and treated promptly. In this project, we propose a novel and efficient method to diagnose diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms.

Project Overview:
The project aims to develop a machine learning-based system capable of automatically detecting diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus images. By utilizing state-of-the-art algorithms, we seek to provide an accurate and reliable solution for early diagnosis and intervention of diabetic retinopathy.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of retinal fundus images collected from diabetic patients. These images serve as the basis for training and evaluating our machine learning models. The dataset is preprocessed and labeled to facilitate supervised learning tasks.

Algorithms:
Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that aims to find the optimal hyperplane to separate data points into different classes. In our project, SVM is utilized to classify retinal fundus images into diabetic retinopathy and non-diabetic retinopathy classes.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN is a non-parametric classification algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors. In our project, KNN is employed to classify retinal fundus images into diabetic retinopathy severity levels.
